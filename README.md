}
```

### Reading Posts

  GET /posts
  ```

  ```

### Updating a Post

PATCH /posts/update/{id}
```

```

### Managing Categories

Thumbnail images are sent as Base64-encoded data in the JSON request body when creating a post. The API handles decoding and saving the images to the server.

## API Documentation
The API endpoints and their usage are documented using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) and can be accessed by running the server and visiting `http://localhost:your-port/api-docs`.
